### A Cultivation mod for us: Minecraft heros.

This mod aims to give the player the ability to get stronger as he/she cultivates (or have a fortuitous encounter) and allows custom crafted spells (Martial Techniques) to be performed as the player can afford for it.

Right now it's just the start, soon after I plan to make add-on mods to make the experience better. Something like more mobs, mod integration, new items, op techniques.

### Cultivation system

The idea is that as the player cultivates, he/she will progress through many levels, being each time harder to breakthrough and sometimes breaking though. I made a system based on what is most read on wuxia novels but it still need tweaking. The levels are the following:

* Energy Perception (5 levels each)
	* Body Refinement
	* Soul Refinement
	* Qi Paths Refinement
	* DanTian Condensing
* Martial Law (10 Levels each)
	* Earth Law
	* Sky Law
	* True Law
	* Martial Law
* Immortal Foundation (15 levels each)
	* Immortality Law
	* Immortality Refinement
	* Immortal Foundation
	* True Immortal
* Divine Law (20 levels each)
	* Immortal Martial
	* Divine Law
	* Divine Phenomenon
	* True God (Infinite Levels)

Each level category will have a different way of cultivating, aiming for more gameplay.
